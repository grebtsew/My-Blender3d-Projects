# Blender3d-Projects

To be a complete gamedeveloper it is suiteable to know how to model your own objects.
In this repo I will save different gameobject-models I create in blender3d.
Some of the objects below are very simple to create, but was hard to replicate
directly in some game-engines, therefore necessary.

# About this Repo
This Repo will work as a gallery and a place for me to drop newly created blender3d objects.
If I follow tutorials or use source material I will share links in folders.
Objects will be of various difficulty.

# How to use these objects in Unity3d
Just open the .blender files in unity3d editor. Might want to add colliders too.

# Creation List
Below are all current accessable objects I prepared so far.

## Chain 1
A simple chain, consisting of several objects.
I followed a tutorial on youtube.
